### UQuic Integration Details

#### Core Implementation
The UQuic integration provides advanced QUIC fingerprinting capabilities for HTTP/3 requests:

**New Structures**:
```go
type HTTP3Transport struct {
    // Existing fields...
    UQuicConfig *uquic.Config
    QUICSpec    *uquic.QUICSpec
    UseUQuic    bool // Enable uquic-based transport when QUIC fingerprint is provided
}

type UQuicHTTP3Transport struct {
    TLSClientConfig *tls.Config
    UQuicConfig     *uquic.Config
    QUICSpec        *uquic.QUICSpec
    DialTimeout     time.Duration
}
```

**New Functions**:
- `NewHTTP3TransportWithUQuic()`: Creates HTTP/3 transport with UQuic fingerprinting
- `NewUQuicHTTP3Transport()`: Creates dedicated UQuic transport
- `CreateUQuicSpecFromFingerprint()`: Converts fingerprint strings to UQuic specs
- `CreateUQuicSpecFromUserAgent()`: Browser-specific QUIC spec generation

**Integration Points**:

### Test Infrastructure Improvements

#### 1. `cycletls/tests/integration/main_ja3_test.go` (HTTP/2 Test Fix)
**Changes Made**:
- **Client Initialization**: Changed from `cycletls.Init()` to `cycletls.Init(false)` to disable worker pool
- **Connection Reuse**: Added `EnableConnectionReuse: true` to both HTTP requests
- **Error Prevention**: Fixed "use of closed network connection" errors

**Before**:
```go
client := cycletls.Init()
response, err := client.Do("https://tls.peet.ws/api/clean", cycletls.Options{
    Ja3:       options.Ja3,
    UserAgent: options.UserAgent,
}, "GET")
```

**After**:
```go
client := cycletls.Init(false) // Disable worker pool for better connection management
response, err := client.Do("https://tls.peet.ws/api/clean", cycletls.Options{
    Ja3:                   options.Ja3,
    UserAgent:             options.UserAgent,
    EnableConnectionReuse: true, // Enable connection reuse to prevent connection issues
}, "GET")
```
